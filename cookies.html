    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Let's walk through how to make chocolate chip cookies step-by-step.</p>

    <h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
    <li>
      The first step in making these easy chocolate chip cookies to to combine
      the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, cream together butter and sugars, make sure to soften the butter
      early by taking it out of the fridge at least two hours before baking so
      it's ready to go when you need it. You can also warm it in the microwave
      for about 7 seconds, but be very careful not to melt it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs & vanilla and beat
      to combine. Add dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Then add the
      chocolate chips and beat until they are evenly distributed throughout the
      dough.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the cookie dough is finished, it's time to portion and roll the
      dough. I know many people eyeball it when making cookies, however I highly
      recommend using a cookie scoop. At this point you can either bake your
      dough or freeze it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake from frozen: Place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet. Then,
      preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (ONLY if you are baking the
      frozen dough) and put the cookies in the oven in the beginning of the
      preheating time. (So put the cookies in the oven as you preheat it). Set
      the timer for 15 minutes and remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top
      will look a little more brown than usual, but they will still taste
      amazing.
