    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <img src="lasagna.jpg" />
    <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
    <p>
      This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer
      the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great
      for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.
    </p>

    <h2><b>Ingredients</b></h2>
    <li>
      Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a
      combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds
      of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.
      We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of
      tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
    </li>
    <li>
      From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of
      noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have
      three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
    </li>
    <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
